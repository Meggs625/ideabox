## Summary of Site

This website allows a user to input title and body text to generate a new idea card. A user can save these idea cards for future reference, as well as remove them from the current window.

## Instructions for Running/Viewing

1. On page load, the user can populate both fields with a catchy title and additional information in the body about their idea. (Fig. A)

2. Note that both fields have to be populated in order for the "Save" button to work (Fig. B). Once both fields are populated, the button should work and have a dark purple background.

3. After the user has selected "Save", their new idea will display in the bottom right hand quadrant of the application. (Fig. C)

4. A user can favorite or unfavorite an idea card by clicking on the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the idea card. Favorite is indicated by an orange star, while unfavorite is indicated by an empty, or white star. (Fig. D)

5. A users idea cards will be saved to their local machine. Upon visiting the page again, the user will see the saved idea cards.

6. A user can delete an idea card from the current window by clicking the "x" icon in the upper right hand corner of the idea card.
